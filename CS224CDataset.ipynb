Is it okay to break conventions sometimes if that would convey the message more effectively? Another question is: Is it now okay to use contractions in formal writing?

Anaphylaxis can lead to a type of shock (lack of oxygen on a tissue level associated with low blood pressure). In fact, low blood pressure is part of the diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis. However, low blood pressure is not required to make the diagnosis! Therefore, physicians sometimes use the diagnosis of anaphylactic shock to describe a patient who has hypotension from an allergen.

The answer to the question must be in the set {(a&lt;b, a&lt;=b), (a&lt;=b), (a=b), (a&gt;=b), (a&gt;b, a&gt;=b)} (otherwise the question should be reformulated: maybe something like \\\"a&lt;b\\\", \\\"a&lt;=b, and a=b for some Y\\\", \\\"a=b\\\" etc)._x0007__x0007_The question deals with medians, means and skewness. The definition of skewness has been informal. Something in the line with: \\\"the sample is left skew if it has a left tail\\\", but what is a tail?_x0007_It is possible to construct a sample that looks somewhat like it has a tail but defies the correct answer to the quiz (compare for example the sets {-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3} and {-3,-3,-3,-3,-3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3}, zeroes added to get some weight in the middle). _x0007__x0007_Wikipedia and wolfram mathworld to rescue!

To calculate the standard deviation you first have to know what the mean is. So when you find the mean you should get -18.5._x0007_The standard deviation means you have to look at how far away each sample is away from the mean. One way to do this by hand is to organize it in a table and subtract the mean from each x-value. Then you can find the squared deviations, the sum of the squared deviations, divide by (n-1), and then take the square root. I have attached a picture to show the work by hand. It is most likely just a computational error. There are many other ways to calculate this in a calculator, Excel spreadsheet, or other statistical software.

            "Question-Could you please explain it. For example if the study was less than 1 year - 7 months. In order to calculate incidence we need person-years of follow up - should we multiply 7 month by number of people in the study. For example it was 100 people. Will it be this way - (100*7/12)-cause in a year its a 12 month. I am very confused with this. And do wee need to calculate person-years of follow-up every time we calculate incidence. Cause i used to have another calculation for incidence = (new cases of the disease divided by population at risk to have this disease at some period of time) - i didn't use person-years of follow-up in this calculation. Please help.:\n",
            " Answers: [('Hello_x0007__x0007_Good questions!_x0007__x0007_So it seems like you are confusing cumulative incidence and incidence rate. _x0007__x0007_CI is a proportion, it is the (# people who develop an outcome / # of people initially at risk). With the CI all people are followed for the same amount of time. _x0007_For example, say you had 40 people in a STATS class and a 1-year period. 14 of these students developed pneumonia. The 1-year cumulative incidence of pneumonia (14/40) or (14/40)*100 = 35 per 100 students. A CI value has no units and the denominator is based on all people who are at risk at risk in the population. It assumes that all people are followed for the same amount of time (in this case a year), and that the population is closed (no people going in or out). _x0007__x0007_Incidence rate (also called incidence density) = # of incident cases / Amount of person time at risk. The best way to think of it is as the occurrence of new cases (of a particular outcome) that arise during a certain amount of person-time of observation. The numerator for CI and incidence rate are exactly the same. The difference is that incidence rate is a true rate because it includes time. _x0007__x0007_In order to understand incidence rate, one needs to talk about person-time. Person-time is only counted up until a person is diagnosed with the outcome of interest. For incidence rate, there is no assumption that everyone is followed for the same amount of time. People can exit and enter the population. So say a person is in a study for 6 months, without getting the outcome, and then drops out - they contribute 6 months to the person time of observation in the candidate population. Say a person is in the study for 12 months, without getting the outcome, and then dies - they contribute 12 months to the person time of observation in the candidate population. Say a person is in the study for 6 months and then gets diagnosed with the outcome of interest - they contribute 6 months to the person time of observation in the candidate population. If these were the only 3 people in the study, the incidence rate would be 1 / 2person-years. The numerator is 1 because 1 person had the outcome and the denominator of the incidence rate is the sum of all the person-times from each member in the candidate population (the population at risk).', 'D5C9F784FE5C9CD849B8753F21B148A2'), ('thanks for clearing tht up.I couldnt make much sense of it on the slides', '2157BD0FAD39284C53DB3C55DACBD39F')]\n",

Let me try explaining both of your questions with one example!_x0007__x0007_As you may have seen in the lectures, a distribution is skewed if one tail is longer than the other (there is a lack of symmetry). With a right skew (also called positive), the bulk (or mass) of the data is on the left and there is a tail extending to the right with extreme values. (Go to google and look a pictures of right skewed data). Do you remember learning about odds ratios? You may remember that Dr. <redacted> mentioned that the sampling distribution of the OR is skewed to the right? If you think about how ORs are calculated and what they mean, it is clear that you cannot have negative values. (A negative OR does not make any sense!). With a limit at the lower end (zero is the limit since it cannot be negative), you get a skewed distribution. An OR can be any positive value from 0 to infinity. With large values on the right...you have right skewed data. So what can you do to ***Transform*** this data to deal with the fact that the distribution is skewed? _x0007__x0007_What happens when you take the log of a negative number (try it on a calculator)?_x0007_What happens when you take the log of a decimal <1 (for example try 0.5 on a calculator)?_x0007_What happens when you take the log of 1? (try it on a calculator)?_x0007_WHat happens when you take the log of 1000? (try it on a calculator)?_x0007__x0007_When you transform data, you replace the variables by a function of the original variable. In many cases, this can change the shape of the distribution. Notice how the log of a large number is a lot smaller (for 1000 you get 6.91)? A logarithmic transformation reduces positive skewness by compressing the right end of the tail and extending the left/lower end. Why does this work?_x0007__x0007_Try ln(1)-ln(.1) = on your calculator..._x0007_Try ln(10) - ln(1) = on your calculator ..._x0007_Try ln(1000) - ln(10) = on your calculator..._x0007__x0007_What do you notice?

However, when you take a sample mean from a sample n, that mean will ALWAYS fall within the values of your sample. You will ALWAYS get a value that is within the range of values that you have sampled. You could have a sample/calculated sample mean and have a situation where the actual population mean falls outside of your sample data. So when you are calculating the sample variance and squaring distances from your SAMPLE mean, you are more likely to get a much lower estimate than the true variance from the actual population mean. This means you are likely to be underestimating the true population variance. Using n-1 provides a better estimate!_x0007__x0007_When you divide by n-1 you divide by a smaller number than n.

I will take a look at this study later today and get back to you with my thoughts! My suspicion is that running 5 minutes a day is probably not enough to do much, but it's likely that most runners are actually running much more than this! More later...\", '0FA78DE09E838CBB5DADAD13460046C7'), ('Basically, the authors found a 30% reduction in all-cause mortality and 45% reduction in heart disease mortality in runners vs. non-runners. This is not surprising. But then they broke runners into quintiles by different running characteristics (such as total time run, speed, and distance run). The Hazard Ratios appeared similar across the different quintiles of running activity. So, they concluded that running a little is just as good as running a lot. The headlines come from the fact that the lowest quintiles included people running <51 min per week (7 minutes per day), <6 miles , and 1 to 2 times per week. There are of course a lot of caveats! (1) When we break data into quintiles, the sample sizes in each quintile are much smaller than the sample size in the overall study. So chance may play a role. (2) People who run 51 minutes per week are probably not running 5-10 minutes per day; they are probably running 1-2 longer runs of several miles. If you are able to run several miles at once, you are probably reasonably fit and may have been running more than this at other times in your life. (3) People who run a small amount may be participating in many other physical activities; though the authors adjusted for this, it was a very crude adjustment. So residual confounding is likely. _x0007_I think we can conclude that running and exercise is good for you.

            " Answers: [(\"Glad you are enjoying the course! Every test you run increases the type of a chance I error, so technically you should correct for all p-values at the same time. However, bear in mind that you probably have a lot of overlap between the tests run with Cox regression and those run with logistic regression, for example. They may be so close to measuring the same thing that you are being conservative by adjusting p-values from both methods. So, I'd recommend that you narrow down the number of tests you are running by using clinical judgment. It's unlikely that you need to do both Cox regression and logistic. Pick one outcome that you care most about and focus on that. Also, given the high chance of false positives here, you might try to do some kind of validation.
